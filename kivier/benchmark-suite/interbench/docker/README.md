# Interbench - The Linux Interactivity Benchmark#### Usage```bashdocker run --rm -t \    --privileged \    ljishen/interbench```###### These are appendable arguments``` -l     Use <int> loops per sec (default: use saved benchmark) -L     Use cpu load of <int> with burn load (default: 4) -t     Seconds to run each benchmark (default: 30) -B     Nice the benchmarked thread to <int> (default: 0) -N     Nice the load thread to <int> (default: 0) -b     Benchmark loops_per_ms even if it is already known -c     Output to console only (default: use console and logfile) -r     Perform real time scheduling benchmarks (default: non-rt) -C     Use <int> percentage cpu as a custom load (default: no custom load) -I     Use <int> microsecond intervals for custom load (needs -C as well) -m     Add <comment> to the log file as a separate line -w     Add <load type> to the list of loads to be tested against -x     Exclude <load type> from the list of loads to be tested against -W     Add <bench> to the list of benchmarks to be tested -X     Exclude <bench> from the list of benchmarks to be tested -h     Show this helpIf run without parameters interbench will run a standard benchmarkRecommend to run as root and set -L to number of CPUs on the system```The default execution performs real time scheduling benchmarks and uses cpu load of 1 with burn load.See [Home Page](https://github.com/Mustaavalkosta/interbench) of The Linux Interactivity Benchmark for more details.
