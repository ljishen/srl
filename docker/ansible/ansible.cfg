# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]

inventory = /root/ansible/hosts

# additional paths to search for roles in, colon separated
#roles_path    = /etc/ansible/roles

# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
# See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_getting_started.html#host-key-checking
host_key_checking = False

# logging is off by default unless this path is defined
# if so defined, consider logrotate
log_path = /var/log/ansible.log

[ssh_connection]

# Control the mechanism for transfering files
#   * smart = try sftp and then try scp [default]
#   * True = use scp only
#   * False = use sftp only
